 Dear Senior Management 
 
 I've struggling with Mr. Meena Ji (as known in the premise) of Allahabad bank, Ambabari Branch, Jaipur, who earlier took unproportionate time to open a current account of my company, Contree Foundation. They never give complete document requirements in one go and then keeps on stalling the process. After a lot of struggle I got it open and decided not to complain. 
 
 Today, I, one of the two directors, went to withdraw money from the current account using cheque with only my signature. Mr. Meena arrogantly denied to process the withdrawal stating that 'Joint by All' is mentioned in the records. 
 
 I asked then, ""How could you process it earlier on two instances when I could withdraw money using signature of just one of the director. No issue was raised then.""
 
 To which Mr. Meena and a few other staff members ganged up to dominate me by saying that,"" Jo ho gaya use jaane do (chuck it what happened earlier"". 
  
 Additionally, to strengthen their claim, one of the staff officer asserted that it is NOT POSSIBLE AT ALL in any circumstance for a single director of a COMPANY to withdraw money WITHOUT the signature of at least two directors as per the Companies Act. This is highly misguiding as he tweaked the rule as per his convenience. 
 
 Either today they were right, but then they were certainly wrong on two previous instances by withdrawing the money with just one director's signature, hence breaching the bank rules. Or they were wrong today.
 
 I, sincerely, wish to ask the senior management of Allahabad Bank that should such employees continue to misguide the bank customers and work according to their personal policies or should they sincerely comply with proper policies of the bank as decided by the senior management? 
 I am highly disappointed by the constant unprofessional behavior of the staff of Allahabad Bank, Ambabari Branch, Jaipur and feel stuck with them as I am running a startup with numerous other challenges. I atleast expect bank to be professional. 
 
 See if you can do anything.

 Â 
 
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This is to inform you I have account in Bank of Baroda in Branch ( Bhitargaon UP ) Branch Code BHITAR.
 
 It is unfortunate that your branch employee including Branch manager harassing me & my relative since yesterday.
 
 Â 
 
 On 07-11-2017 Â I had presented one cheque amounting 80,000/- in favour of myself & drawer was Ms Rekha awasthi.
 
 But cashier declined my payment by saying â€œ AADHAAR No is not feeded in rekha devi account so you canâ€™t get the paymentâ€
 
 Â 
 
 As per my knowledge bank canâ€™t denied for payment due to AADHAAR yet I called Ms rekha devi for AADHAAR seeding in account.
 
 Â 
 
 The matter is not ended yet after AADHAAR seeding cashier demanded for PAN card which is genuine ground but it should be asked before
 
 Then I again called Ms Rekha devi for PAN card updation .
 
 Â 
 
 After Pan card updation the uneducated cashier replied now cash is closed you come tomorrow with monalisa smile.
 
 Â 
 
 I have complained about it to the Branch Manager & the reply of Branch manager is another level.
 
 Â 
 
 He said â€œ Should I sit in cash room, you can leave the branch & come tomorrowâ€
 
 Â 
 
 I am government teacher & the humiliating behavior of your employee is not appreciable at all.
 
 Â 
 
 You can also check CCTV footage of branch ( 07-11-2017 & 08-11-2017 )
 
 Â 
 
 I urge you to please look into this matter on priority basis.

 But, I made this two orders which changed my perception completely, not only regarding the food offered by swiggy, but regarding the customer dealing way of swiggy.
 
 
 I ordered food from the restaurant, the food was completely uncooked, bad in taste and saltless.. i never tasted such bad food in recent times.
 
 
 When i complained, first swiggy personal asked me details, then picture of the food, then for returning the food, i agreed to all the conditions, and then they told me that they will provide me refund of only food cost and not delivery charges.
 
 
 I mean who with the sane mind will pay delivery charges for a pathetic quality food?
 
 You wasted my time, sent me bad quality food when i am hungry, and ask me to pay delivery charges for it?
 
 And again told me that they wont give me my coupons back of rs 175 (75+100) that i used in that order?
 
 Instead of understanding the matter, the swiggy personal credited me rs. 78 (illogically) and didnt even bothered to listen to my grievance..
 Its my plea to Swiggy that, I really dont need the amount as ""TIP"" & Request Swiggy to please debit the same amount.
 
 I have never seen such a lame response before, I regularly use Zomato, and swiggy and food panda, and others, but never seen such bad response before.
 
 
 This will make me think twice, to use swiggy again.
 
 I mailed to Swiggy, and they said to revert within 24 hours, its more than 50 hours, they neither reverted, nor made any communication, whereas i dropped 2 mails as query, which went unattended.
 
 Please kindly look on to this matter, nd revert me back asap.

 Â I am Aakash Girwal,one of your first time customers.I needed to purchase a phone for me so i purchased a ""Infinix Note 4""(Order Id- OD 110431675364563000)from flipkart despite the fact that few people told me not to purchase it from flipkart telling me that flipkart has the worst return/refund policy but thinking that flipkart being one of the largest ecommerce platform in the country i will have no such problem but when i got my order delivered and used the phone i faced serious battery drain issues so thinking it as a manufacturing defect i applied for replacement and as i expected from flipkart they accepted replacement request and maid my faith in flipkart stronger.But when i got the replacement i started to face same battery drain issue and even the camera quality was very low as compared to first one purchased and i also visted the company's service but they too were not able to solve the problem and the most suprising fact was that when i checked the invoice it had a diffrent seller(Savan Retailers pvt. Ltd.) name than what was shown on flipkart site(Flashstar Commerce)
 
 Â i seriously doubt that it is refurbished or used product.
 
 And to my suprise when i contacted flipkart customer care executive he instead of solving my issue abruptly told me that there can be no refund and when i asked about the invoice mistake he told me that that it is between the seller and flipkart and not important for me.
 
 This is a clear fraud,at least the customer should be notified about such thing because the customer purchases product by having faith in seller name too but here i wasnt notified of any such imformation and even flipkart says that the a flipkart assured product goes through 6 quality checks but by seeing this product it doesn't seem like that.
 
 Â Â Otherwise i assure that this will be my first and last purchase from flipkart and anyone who asks me Â a opinion about flipkart will also never purchase from flipkart. Flipkart being such a large e-commerce platform which has earned such respect in the market i would never like to do anything that will degrade flipkart's reputation but if my issue is not resolved i will be forced to raise this issue on social media platforms and also to take legal action in consumer court.
 
 
 But i expect that Â flipkart will not do such thing with its customer, restore my faith back in flipkart and solve my issue by giving me back my refund back for the purchase and resolving this issue as fast as possible.

Flipkart is just making false promises that they will do something ASAP but all my efforts have been in Vain. I got 3 calls from different executives who gave me different information and confused me even more. The reverse pickup had to be done latest by 23rd September but Today is 25th September and there has been no response by them. I am shopping after a long time from Flipkart and I am feeling that Flipkart doesn't care about the customer anymore once the shipment is delivered. It was very different in the past and now the service has become thrash. I will never shop from Flipkart in the future and even approach the consumer court and approach media pages on Facebook to let people know how Flipkart is treating it's customer's now. Will also make a post on my wall and share it as much as possible on Facebook and whatsapp. I want a reverse pickup ASAP and want a refund ASAP. Really very dissapointed.

 My dad, Ramchandra Rajpure, holds a pension account in BOI. It's been years now that we all family members have account in this branch of the bank.
 
 Today we had gone to the bank to provide adhaar card copy to the bank as the pension was stopped for past few months. The delay in submitting the adhaar card was due to the reason that my father suffers from paralysis and the fingerprint impression was not possible to capture on regular machine. We now have it after several follow ups with the agency.
 
 Coming to the point, today when we went to submit the copy to the bank from Kharghar to Vashi, the bank employee asked us to check our passbook for the landline number and call on that number tomorrow morning to enquire when to come to the branch.
 With no other explanation provided he said rudely to get out from the bank. He was also of the opinion that with there are many people coming to the branch from all parts of Navi Mumbai everyday. So it's ok for BOI to give such replies.
