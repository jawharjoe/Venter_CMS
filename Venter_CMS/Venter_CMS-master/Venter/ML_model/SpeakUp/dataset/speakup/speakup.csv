Dear Senior Management 

I've struggling with Mr. Meena Ji (as known in the premise) of Allahabad bank, Ambabari Branch,  Jaipur, who earlier took unproportionate time to open a current account of my company, Contree Foundation. They never give complete document requirements in one go and then keeps on stalling the process. After a lot of struggle I got it open and decided not to complain. 

Today, I, one of the two directors, went to withdraw money from the current account using cheque with only my signature. Mr. Meena arrogantly denied to process the withdrawal stating that 'Joint by All' is mentioned in the records. 

I asked then, ""How could you process it earlier on two instances when I could withdraw money using signature of just one of the director. No issue was raised then.""

To which Mr. Meena and a few other staff members ganged up to dominate me by saying that,"" Jo ho gaya use jaane do (chuck it what happened earlier"". 
 
Additionally, to strengthen their claim, one of the staff officer asserted that it is NOT POSSIBLE AT ALL in any circumstance for a single director of a COMPANY to withdraw money WITHOUT the signature of at least two directors as per the Companies Act. This is highly misguiding as he tweaked the rule as per his convenience. 

Either today they were right,  but then they were certainly wrong on two previous instances by withdrawing the money with just one director's signature, hence breaching the bank rules. Or they were wrong today.

I, sincerely, wish to ask the senior management of Allahabad Bank that should such employees continue to misguide the bank customers and work according to their personal policies or should they sincerely comply with proper policies of the bank as decided by the senior management? 
I am highly disappointed by the constant unprofessional behavior of the staff of Allahabad Bank, Ambabari Branch, Jaipur and feel stuck with them as I am running a startup with numerous other challenges. I atleast expect bank to be professional. 

See if you can do anything.
